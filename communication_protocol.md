# Communication Protocol Team 12
Our team will take a 3-pronged approach to communication via:
- Regular check-ins on Zoom
- Slack chat group
- Github discussion board
Pull requests are required to protect the main branch. Changes require team member review before being pushed to main and comments will be used to communicate adjustments or clarifications on proposed changes.
